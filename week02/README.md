# Week02 - Promises (async/await) + Node.JS Start

## First Part:
Finalizing the final required review about using the "Syntactic Sugar" for working with "Promises":
- Promises Syntactic Sugar (async/await):
    - [JavaScript Programming - Lecture15 - Promises (Part3)](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/javascript-code/blob/main/week15/script.js)

## Second Part:
Then starting with Node.js (JavaScript Runtime Environment). Notice that the code files (examples) of this week are taken from my GitHub repo ["Start with Node"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start). We covered the first part (index1 - index5) of that repo in this week. The rest (index6 - till the end) will covered in tne next week.

### Code Sequence:
- demo1.js
- demo2.js

It's strongly recommended to read/review the [README.MD](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start) file of "Starting with Node" repo.
