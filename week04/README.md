# Week04 - Node.JS working with modules:
Notice that the code files (examples) of this week are taken from my GitHub repo ["Start with Node"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start). We covered the final part (index6 - till the end) of that repo in this week. 

It's strongly recommended to read/review the [README.MD](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start) file of "Starting withNode" repo.

# In-Class Code Sequence:
- scrip1.js => about using files
- main1.js and utilities1.js => using CJS
- main2.js and utilities2.js => using MJS

# Required Settings For MJS (Module Java Script):
1- Create **"package.json"** file
 - Manually as we create any file in VS Code. We will have an empty file!
 - Initialize it with npm command:
   - Node Package Manager:
     -=> npm init (filled with questions to be answered!)
     -=> npm init -y (skip all questions by using default values)
2- Modify this JSON file by adding this key:value:
    - "type": Module JS or Common JS (default)
