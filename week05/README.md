# Week05 In-Class Code:
Notice that the code files (examples) of this week are taken from my GitHub repo ["Start with Node"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start). We covered the final part (index6 - till the end) of that repo in this week. 

It's strongly recommended to read/review the [README.MD](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start) file of "Starting withNode" repo.
