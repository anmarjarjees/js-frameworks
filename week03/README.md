# Week03 In-Class Code:

## First Part:
Finalizing the final required review about using the "Syntactic Sugar" with "Promises":
- index.html => for loading the JS file
- script.js => the full code for reviewing async/await

## Second Part:
Then starting with Node.js (JavaScript Runtime Environment). Notice that the code files (examples) of this week are taken from my GitHub repo ["Start with Node"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start). We covered the first part (index1 - index5) of that repo in this week. The rest (index6 - till the end) will covered in tne next week.

It's strongly recommended to read/review the [README.MD](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start) file of "Starting with Node" repo.
